    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A peanut butter and jelly sandwich (PB&J) consists of peanut butter and fruit preserves—jelly—spread on bread. 
        The sandwich may be open-faced, made of a single slice of bread folded over, or made between two slices of bread. 
        The sandwich is popular in the United States, especially among children; a 2002 survey showed the average American will eat 1,500 before graduating from high school.
         There are many variations on the sandwich, starting with the basic peanut butter sandwich or jam sandwich.</p>
